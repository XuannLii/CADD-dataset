This is the dataset CADD of the paper "ChemLiteNet: An Efficient and Lightweight Network for Chemical Apparatus Detection."

#brief introduction
The CADD dataset consists of 2,000 real-world images collected from authentic teaching scenes, including online education platforms and classroom videos. All images are annotated with bounding boxes for 24 categories of commonly used chemical apparatus at the secondary school level: ph indicator paper, color chart, cover-glass, jars, cork, glass rod, test tube, alcohol burner, hand, funnel, tweezers, test tube brush, iron frame platform, tripod, evaporating dish, spoon, measuring cylinder, beaker, dropper, narrow necked bottle, mortar, glass catheter, asbestos net, test tube clamp.
